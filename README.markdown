# What is the purpose of this repository?

This is my collection of solutions to code challenges from Codecademy. While I absolutely love the codecademy courses, there are times I think the solutions are minimal. Some of the uses of bootstrap result in odd shifting or stacking of elements. While I understand a course  focus maybe on someother aspect, as a visual designer ~~I would really like~~ a small piece of me dies inside if something I work on isn't perfect. What you'll find here are my "improved" versions as well as works in progress.

I also like to experiment with rem && em vs px, and test other fun stuff. Because when you experiment you find ways to break stuff, and then can rebuild them stronger. It's also a chance to use github-like just now I discovered [how to make strike-thus] (https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) -so feel free to teach yourself a few things, maybe we even work a pull request into the mix eh?
